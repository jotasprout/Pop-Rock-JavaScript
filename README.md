# rockinJS
JavaScript version of [myRockinApp](https://github.com/jotasprout/myRockinApp) (Python) using the Spotify API to get data about an artist, their albums, and those albums' songs to store in a MySQL database and track popularity over time as well as comparing popularity to similar data from other artists/albums/songs.

## Status
Abandoned.

Moved on to using PHP and MySQL with [Pop-PHP](https://github.com/jotasprout/Pop-PHP) because I couldn't get the objects to build as completely as I wanted. Same reason I moved from Python to Javascript. Regarding **Pop-PHP**, its front-end is now largely Javascript as my skills have improved over the last couple years.
