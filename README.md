# Pop Rock (JavaScript)
Uses Spotify API to get data about artists, their albums, and those albums' songs to store in a MySQL database and track popularity over time as well as comparing popularity to similar data from other artists/albums/songs.

## Status
Resurrected. Recreating as Node.js Progressive Web App.

### History
Moved on to using PHP and MySQL with [Pop-PHP](https://github.com/jotasprout/Pop-PHP) because I couldn't get the objects to build as completely as I wanted. Same reason I originally created a Javascript version of [myRockinApp](https://github.com/jotasprout/myRockinApp) (Python). 

**UPDATE February 2018:** Regarding [Pop-PHP](https://github.com/jotasprout/Pop-PHP), its front-end is now largely Javascript as my skills have improved over the last couple years.

**UPDATE October 2018:** Pop-PHP increasingly using Javascript so I want to move that stuff over here so there is are examples of both my Javascript and PHP skills.
